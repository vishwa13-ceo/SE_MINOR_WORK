Task A1: Call by Value in C
 
Task A1 demonstrates the concept of Call by Value in the C programming language.
In this task, we came to know how function parameters are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the variable is passed to the function. 
Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.

Task A2 : Study on Usability and make report on 2 UIs about Usability

In this task, we dive into the usability of two popular software products:
Microsoft Word and Google Docs. 

Usability is all about how user-friendly and satisfying a software product is. 
In this report, I’ll break down what makes Microsoft Word and Google Docs stand out (or not) when it comes to usability.

Product 1: Microsoft Word
 
The interface is pretty straightforward, making it easy to find what you need. The ribbon menu has all the tools laid out nicely, so we don’t have to hunt for them.
 
There are loads of tutorials and help articles available, which are super handy for figuring things out when you’re stuck.



Product 2: Google Docs
 
Google Docs is great for teamwork ,we can edit documents at the same time with your friends or teammates, we can see changes instantly. The commenting feature makes giving feedback super easy.

We can use Google Docs on pretty much any device with internet access. Whether we're on phone, tablet, or laptop,docs are always available.
