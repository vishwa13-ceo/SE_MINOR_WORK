<h2>Task A1: Call by Value in C<h2>
 
Task A1 demonstrates the concept of Call by Value in the C programming language.
In this task, we came to know how function parameters are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the variable is passed to the function. 
Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.

<h2>Task A2 : Study on Usability and make report on 2 UIs about Usability</h2>

In this task, we dive into the usability of two popular software products:
Microsoft Word and Google Docs. 

Usability is all about how user-friendly and satisfying a software product is. 
In this report, I’ll break down what makes Microsoft Word and Google Docs stand out (or not) when it comes to usability.

Product 1: Microsoft Word
 
The interface is pretty straightforward, making it easy to find what you need. The ribbon menu has all the tools laid out nicely, so we don’t have to hunt for them.
 
There are loads of tutorials and help articles available, which are super handy for figuring things out when you’re stuck.



Product 2: Google Docs
 
Google Docs is great for teamwork ,we can edit documents at the same time with your friends or teammates, we can see changes instantly. The commenting feature makes giving feedback super easy.

We can use Google Docs on pretty much any device with internet access. Whether we're on phone, tablet, or laptop,docs are always available.






<h2>Task A3: Features of Programming Languages</h2>

Features of Robust Code
1.Error Handling:
In our divide method, I added a check for division by zero. If you try to divide by zero, the program won't crash, it'll just display the error message.

2.Strong Typing:
By using specific data types like int, Java helps us avoid mistakes that can happen when we mix different types. This makes our code safer and easier to understand.

3.Modularity:
I broke the code into methods like divide and createArray. This way, each piece does its own job, making it easier to read and maintain.

4.Array Management:
The createArray method shows how to create an array. It's straightforward and can be easily modified if we need different sizes.

5.Input Validation:
While I didn’t go deep into user inputs here, the structure of the code allows for easy checks in the future if we decide to add user interaction.

6.Clear Output:
I made sure to include messages that explain what's happening in the program. This helps anyone reading the output understand what’s going on.

7.Resource Management:
By using arrays correctly, we can manage memory effectively. This keeps our program running smoothly and efficiently.

8.Simplicity:
The overall design is simple. By keeping it straightforward, we reduce the chances of bugs and make it easier for anyone to follow along later.
