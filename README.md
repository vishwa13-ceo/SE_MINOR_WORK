Task A1: Call by Value in C
 
Task A1 demonstrates the concept of Call by Value in the C programming language.
In this task, we came to know how function parameters are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the variable is passed to the function. 
Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.
